## Installation

### Dependencies
- Ruby 2.1.0

- wkhtmltopdf (To be downloaded from [this website](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/) and placed in lib folder)

### Clone Fluxday
```sh
git clone https://github.com/foradian/fluxday.git  
```

### Install bundler and required gems
Once the specified version of Ruby is installed with all its dependencies satisfied, run the following commands from the root directory of the application. (You can skip this section if you are using docker)
```sh

```
If you are using Mysql or Mariadb

```sh
bundle install --with mysql --without test development
```

If you want to use postgresql

```sh
bundle install --with postgresql --without test development
```

### Configure application

For google authentication, you need to set up the corresponding key, secret, callback url etc. The application loads these informations from the file config/app_config.yml
The sample configuration is available at [config/app_config.yml.example](https://github.com/foradian/fluxday/blob/master/config/app_config.yml.example) (You can simply copy this file to app_config.yml to run Fluxday without google authentication).
```sh
cp config/app_config.yml.example config/app_config.yml
```
### Create and configure database

#### 1. With docker
```sh
cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
cp app.env.example app.env
```
Database configurations relies on the file app.env . After above steps update this file with actual credentials.

#### 2. Without docker
```sh
cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
```
Update the credentials in database.yml with actual values.

Now you can create the database and perform migrations
```sh
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
```
Fluxday will populate the database with an admin user entry when we run the seed.
```sh
rake db:seed
```
### Start the application

#### 1. With docker
Start container with:
```sh
docker-compose up -d --build --remove-orphans
```

And to access the container:

```sh
docker exec -it fluxday /bin/bash
